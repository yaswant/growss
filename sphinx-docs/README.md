# Build Sphinx Documentation and Deploy to GitHub Pages

A reusable GitHub Actions [workflow](../.github/workflows/sphinx-docs.yaml) that
builds [Sphinx documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and optionally
deploys it to GitHub Pages.

## Features

- Auto-detects dependencies from `conf.py` (highest priority), falling back to
  `pyproject.toml` in the docs tree, then the repo root
- Supports forcing `pyproject.toml` resolution via `use-pyproject: true`,
  bypassing `conf.py` entirely — useful when dependencies are already declared
  under `[project.optional-dependencies]` or `[dependency-groups]`
- When resolving from `conf.py`, detects packages from both `extensions` and
  `html_theme`
- Lints documentation source with
  [`sphinx-lint`](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/sphinx-lint)
- Uses `make html` if a `Makefile` is present in the docs directory, otherwise
  falls back to `sphinx-build`
- Deploys to GitHub Pages **only on pushes to the upstream `main` branch** —
  never from forks or pull requests

## Supported Directory Layouts

### Typical layout (default)

```text
repo/
├── pyproject.toml        # optional — used if no conf.py found, or forced via use-pyproject
├── src/
└── docs/
    ├── Makefile          # optional
    └── source/
        ├── conf.py       # highest priority for dependency resolution
        └── index.rst
```

Use with defaults — no input overrides required:

```yaml
jobs:
  docs:
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/sphinx-docs.yaml@main
```

### Flat docs layout

```text
repo/
├── pyproject.toml        # optional — used if no conf.py found, or forced via use-pyproject
└── docs/
    ├── Makefile          # optional
    ├── conf.py           # highest priority for dependency resolution
    └── index.rst
```

Override `source-dir` to point to `docs`:

```yaml
jobs:
  docs:
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/sphinx-docs.yaml@main
    with:
      source-dir: docs
```

| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `pages-url` | URL of the deployed GitHub Pages site |

## Permissions

The calling workflow must grant the following permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

## Usage Examples

### Minimal — build and deploy on push to `main`

```yaml
name: Docs

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  docs:
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/sphinx-docs.yaml@main
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
```

### Full — build on PRs, deploy only when merged to `main`

```yaml
name: Docs

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]
  workflow_dispatch:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  docs:
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/sphinx-docs.yaml@main
    with:
      python-version: "3.12"
      runner: ubuntu-24.04
      timeout-minutes: 10
      docs-dir: docs
      source-dir: docs/source
      build-dir: _build
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
```

> **Note:** You do not need to pass `deploy: ${{ github.ref_name == 'main' }}`
> yourself. The workflow enforces deployment guards internally — it will only
> deploy when **all** of the following are true:
>
> - `deploy` input is `true` (the default)
> - The ref is exactly `refs/heads/main`
> - The run is on the **upstream** repository, not a fork
> - The event is **not** a `pull_request`

### Force `pyproject.toml` with optional dependencies

Use this when Sphinx dependencies are declared under
`[project.optional-dependencies]` in your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
docs = [
    "sphinx",
    "furo",
    "myst-parser",
    "sphinx-copybutton",
]
```

```yaml
jobs:
  docs:
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/sphinx-docs.yaml@main
    with:
      use-pyproject: true
      extras: docs # → uv sync --extra docs
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
```

### Force `pyproject.toml` with a dependency group (PEP 735)

Use this when dependencies are declared under `[dependency-groups]`:

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[dependency-groups]
docs = [
    "sphinx",
    "furo",
    "myst-parser",
    "sphinx-copybutton",
]
```

```yaml
jobs:
  docs:
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/sphinx-docs.yaml@main
    with:
      use-pyproject: true
      extras: docs # → uv sync --group docs
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
```

The workflow automatically inspects `pyproject.toml` to determine whether
`extras` refers to an optional-dependency extra (`--extra`) or a dependency
group (`--group`) and sets the correct `uv sync` flag. If the name is not found
in either section, a warning is emitted and plain `uv sync` is run.

### Build only, no deployment

```yaml
jobs:
  docs:
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/sphinx-docs.yaml@main
    with:
      deploy: false
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
```

### Use the deployed URL in a downstream job

```yaml
jobs:
  docs:
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/sphinx-docs.yaml@main
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write

  notify:
    needs: docs
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - run: echo "Docs published at ${{ needs.docs.outputs.pages-url }}"
```

## Dependency Resolution

Dependencies are resolved in the following order of precedence:

| Priority | Condition                                                | Action                                                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| —        | `use-pyproject: true` + `pyproject.toml` in `docs-dir`   | Run `uv sync [flags]` from `docs-dir`; skip `conf.py`                             |
| —        | `use-pyproject: true` + `pyproject.toml` in `source-dir` | Run `uv sync [flags]` from `source-dir`; skip `conf.py`                           |
| —        | `use-pyproject: true` + `pyproject.toml` at root         | Run `uv sync [flags]` from repo root; skip `conf.py`                              |
| —        | `use-pyproject: true` + no `pyproject.toml` found        | **Fails** with an error                                                           |
| 1        | `conf.py` found in `source-dir` (default)                | Parse `extensions` and `html_theme`; install mapped packages via `uv pip install` |
| 2        | `pyproject.toml` found in `docs-dir`                     | Run `uv sync [flags]` from `docs-dir`                                             |
| 3        | `pyproject.toml` found in `source-dir`                   | Run `uv sync [flags]` from `source-dir`                                           |
| 4        | `pyproject.toml` found at repo root                      | Run `uv sync [flags]` from repo root                                              |
| —        | None of the above                                        | **Fails** with an error                                                           |

### `extras` and `uv sync` flags

When `extras` is set and a `pyproject.toml` is used, the workflow inspects the
file to determine the correct `uv sync` flag:

| Section in `pyproject.toml`       | `uv sync` flag emitted               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `[project.optional-dependencies]` | `--extra <extras>`                   |
| `[dependency-groups]` (PEP 735)   | `--group <extras>`                   |
| Not found in either               | _(plain `uv sync`, warning emitted)_ |

### `conf.py` parsing

When `conf.py` is used as the dependency source, the workflow extracts packages
from two variables:

- **`extensions`** — each entry is looked up in a built-in mapping of known
  Sphinx extension module names to PyPI package names. Unknown third-party
  extensions not in the mapping are included using a best-effort guess derived
  from the module root (e.g. `my_ext.sub` → `my-ext`). Built-in `sphinx.ext.*`
  extensions are always skipped as they are bundled with Sphinx.
- **`html_theme`** — the theme name is looked up in a built-in mapping of known
  theme names to PyPI package names. Built-in Sphinx themes (e.g. `alabaster`,
  `classic`) are skipped. Unknown themes are included using a best-effort guess
  (e.g. `my_theme` → `my-theme`).

`sphinx` and `sphinx-lint` are always installed regardless of `conf.py` content.

### Deployment guards

The `deploy` input enables deployment intent, but the workflow enforces the
following additional conditions internally to prevent accidental deployments
from forks or pull requests:

| Condition                                                | Purpose                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deploy` input is `true`                                 | Caller opt-in                                           |
| `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`                        | Exact ref match — rules out all other branches and tags |
| `github.repository == github.event.repository.full_name` | Upstream repo only — excludes forks                     |
| `github.event_name != 'pull_request'`                    | Belt-and-braces guard against PR events                 |
