# Track Review Project Action

This action modifies the Simulation Systems Review Tracker project entries in
pull requests. It will automatically fill the reviewer fields based on the
entries in the pull request template. It will change the state based on reviews
requested and performed. If a CR hasn't been requested, it will do so when
moving to the CR state. It will also add the PR author as an assignee if none
exist.

In order for this to work with forks when reviews are completed, a triggering
workflow is also required. This can be shown by the "Trigger Project Workflow"
yaml file below. The "Track Action Project" workflow is triggered by this
workflow via github "workflow_run" syntax.

It requires a PAT with permissions to write to projects to be added as a secret
to the repository with the name `PROJECT_ACTION_PAT`. Project edits made using
this token will be shown as performed by the owner of the token.
